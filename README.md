## Module Description

### Dataset design

### Login and Register
When the user registering, we use Prop in Vue to check the mailbox format at the front end. After the user input the email, we use axios to asynchronously request the back end to check duplicate mailboxes, and ensure that the verification code is valid at the back end.

When the user logging in, after the user submit his information, we use crypto.js to encrypt user's information during transmission. And we will storage the username and password if the user choose 'Remember me'

### Visualization

We used the radar chart in echart to show the userâ€™s writing ability, and encapsulated the star rating component to further visualize

### Access control and authentication
For access control, our general consideration is as following:
    
    The front end ensures that ordinary users do not enter the management page through page controls 

    The backend ensures that users cannot obtain management permissions by stitching URLs or simulating http access

For detailed implementation, we use Token(JWT), our implementation step are shown in the following graph:

For information storage, we use Vuex, and we also storage a backup in localStoraage to prevent user information from being lost during refresh
